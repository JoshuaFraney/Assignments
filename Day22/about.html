				<span>My name is Roger the Alien.  As you can see in the photo to the left, I am a patriotic alien stuck on this planet after my ship crash landed.  I live in the attic of the Smith family household and some people may say I am very outspoken... maybe too much so for my own good.  Wine and animals are big favorites of mine.  I'm learning how to be a successful web designer/programmer for the Social Security Administration.  My daily hobbies include becoming different characters with different costumes/wigs and becoming those personas such as becoming a detective, a businessman, a bartender, etc.  I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me!
