			<li><h3>Home Page:</h3> The Home Page is where you will find most of the great features of my website.  The SSA Team C Java/JavaScript class roster is listed in a table that shows all of the student's names, departments they work in, their supervisors, their start dates, and a photo of each student (props to the photographer on those great pics!).  It also contains two lists containing things that I think are going well for the class so far and another containing things that I think could be done to improve the class going forward.
			</li>
			<li><h3>About Page:</h3> The About Page is where you will find a photograph of me, Roger the Alien, and a brief description of myself for all those curious readers out there.
			</li>
			<li><h3>Help Page:</h3> The Help Page is where you are now! It contains descriptions of all the pages you can browse through the navigation bar to see on my website.
